# NavAnalyst

This reference application shows how many of the [AGI.Foundation.Navigation](https://help.agi.com/AGIComponents/html/N_AGI_Foundation_Navigation.htm) types and methods can be used. This application is designed to show a navigation analyst a quick-look picture of the Dilution of Precision (DOP) for a site, which satellites are in view of that site, and the azimuth and elevation of the satellites at that site. An open-source charting package called [ZedGraph](http://sourceforge.net/projects/zedgraph/) is used to draw the graphs in the application.

For more information on the application, see [the topic for this example](https://help.agi.com/AGIComponents/html/ExampleNavAnalyst.htm) in the STK Components documentation.
